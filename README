This project serves application developers by providing the URL equivalent across various platforms and applications. As long as you know one type of platform's URL, you can find all other platforms' URLs using the hosted service at http://xendig.com/api/besturl

For example: you're writing a web app and you'd like all IOS devices that access your site to use fb:// instead of the web URL. You provide the web url and all other platform formats are returned. Now all you need to do is include code to decide on the best URL to use on the specific platform.

This project is hosted here: http://xendig.com/api/besturl
